
### Queue
- We use queues in our daily lives everywhere, in front of lines in our rollercoaster rides, medical systems, banking, finance, everywhere. And they come in all sorts of forms. The most basic takes only time in consideration, namely the first elements will be the first to be attended.
    - But there are also variations, such as priority queues, which take into consideration a series of factors. For example, in medical organ donation, we might consider the risk of death and urgency for the patient to receive a transplant (very complex system with some simplifications here, and in fact could be optimized with software). 
    - The same applies to computer science, where these queues are useful for designing these systems as well as supporting algorithms such as breadth-first search, and priority queues for A* search.
    
    Breadth-first search basically starts with an element and considers all the elements connected to it, before going to the next level. Whereas A*
    search looks into factors such as the cost of moving to the node and the estimated distance reduction to the goal.

### Trees
 - Trees are again just another form of organizing data in a way that provides benefits for certain applications. It is called a Tree because it has branches, like real life trees do. Most think of it as an upside down tree.  For example:
    3
   / \
  5  1
 / \
0   2
    - Trees come in all sorts and forms, depending on the application we are desigining them for there are advantages in choosing one type from another, and we will look at each of those indidually as well as examine the trade-offs in future sessions. But it is easy to understand the great advantage of trees at all by talking about binary search trees (BSTs). Their one rule is that:
    - For every node, its left child contains a value smaller than or equal to itself, and its right child is larger. E.g:
    4
   / \
  2   5
 / \
1   3

We can see that finding an element here only takes O(log(n)) time for a generally balanced tree. We will also looking at the problem of unbalenced trees later (where most the height of one of the children is much larger than the other, and worst case run time is O(n), to solve this we have balancing algorithms)

### Graphs
   - Graphs, just like trees, are another way to represent data. A tree is actually just a specific form of a graph. Graphs are very important when we want to model items that have a relationship with one another, like trees. Every tree is a graph, but not every graph is a tree because some graphs can contain cycles (loops) and trees cannot.

### Session 2 - Basic Algorithms examples

Talk points: Here we will see the importance of algorithms in designing efficient applications, and how we can benefit from using the advantages of efficient data structures and algorithms together to create very powerful systems.

### Applications of Sorting

  One of the most basic algorithms is sorting. Everyone is familiar with sorting. In real life we might have a bookshelf sorted by alphabetical order, which is useful for retrieving and finding the correct book at a later time.
  
There are many problems where sorting first will help to solve the problem more efficiently.

## Session 1 - Search Trees,  and Balanced Trees

For interviews, definitely know the properties and implementation of binary search trees. For balanced trees, know the general advantages of each, but you will probably not be asked to straight up implement an AVL Tree. You might have to do something that uses that idea where you would more or less end up inventing it on the fly.

### Home Reading:

- **Splay trees**
        - In practice:
            Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors,
            data compression, ropes (replacement of string used for long text strings), in Windows NT (in the virtual memory,
            networking, and file system code) etc.

 -  **Red/black trees**
        - In practice:
            Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time.
            Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications,
            but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees;
            for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and
            the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In the version 8 of Java,
            the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor
            hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used.

- **2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees)**
        - In practice:
            For every 2-4 tree, there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion
            operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an
            important tool for understanding the logic behind red–black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce
            2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though **2-4 trees are not often used in practice**.

-  **B-Trees**
        - fun fact: it's a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor)
        - In Practice:
            B-Trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to
            its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary
            block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block i address into a disk block
            (or perhaps to a cylinder-head-sector) address.

### Home Reading

Graphs are a huge subject in computer science, there are many applications in which they are powerful. From modeling the relationships between people in social networks, to representing connections of genomic data in trying to understand patterns of diseases, they are very useful. There are many ways to represent them and we will understand them below:

## Interview Tips


### Coding Question Practice

Now that you know all the computer science topics above, it's time to practice answering coding problems.

**Coding question practice is not about memorizing answers to programming problems.**

Why you need to practice doing programming problems:
- problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in
- gathering requirements for the problem
- talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview
- coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer
- coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions
- testing your solutions

There is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem solving in an interview. You'll get this from the programming
interview books, too, but I found this outstanding:
- [ ] [Algorithm design canvas](http://www.hiredintech.com/algorithm-design/)

No whiteboard at home? That's fine, buy one. Or don't if that's really an issue, but just practice on paper and practice whiteboarding skills at school or something. You should really practice on whiteboard though, to mimick the real interview setting. But the main thing you want to practice is to practice under stress, there's nothing like coding in front of a guy who is going to decide whether you get a job or not, and then you're as nervous as you've never been before. 

The solution? Practice that. How? Every interview you get the opportunity in doing, do it. Even if it's a company you don't care much about, you will still be practicing coding while someone else is looking at you and your subconscious mind constantly fighting you by making you afraid of being embarassed. Trust me, I had the biggest issues with this, the only way to get over it was to interview dozens and dozens of times, just like speaking in public or anything of the sort. The more you do it, the more you realize the worst case scenario is not nearly as big of a deal as your pessimistic-self anticipates, and in that process you will become less and less nervous each time you attempt something similar.

#### Interview Questions

Think of about 20 interview questions you'll get, along the lines of the items below. Have 2-3 answers for each.
Have a story, not just data, about something you accomplished.

- Why do you want this job?
- What's a tough problem you've solved?
- Biggest challenges faced?
- Best/worst designs seen?
- Ideas for improving an existing Google product.
- How do you work best, as an individual and as part of a team?
- Which of your skills or experiences would be assets in the role and why?
- What did you most enjoy at [job x / project y]?
- What was the biggest challenge you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What was the hardest bug you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What did you learn at [job x / project y]?
- What would you have done better at [job x / project y]?

#### Questions for the interviewer

- How large is your team?
- What does your dev cycle look like? Do you do waterfall/sprints/agile?
- Are rushes to deadlines common? Or is there flexibility?
- How are decisions made in your team?
- How many meetings do you have per week?
- Do you feel your work environment helps you concentrate?
- What are you working on?
- What do you like about it?
- What is the work life like?
