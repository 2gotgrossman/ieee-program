# Intro to Javascript and Python

You should be here if:
1. You want to learn Javascript
2. You want to learn Python
3. You want to learn to code in any language
4. You want to become Hacker Person!!!

## Javascript AND Python???
We will be teaching both Javascript and Python concurrently. Take your pick!
1. Javascript is the language of the internet. 
    - Front End graphics and web design is done mostly in Javascript
    - You can write back end servers using Javascript packages
    - It has some really cool new features, I swear!
2. Python is varied in its use
    - Data science
    - Scientific use cases galore
    - Anything you ever want to do has already been done for you.
3. Most things you can do in both Python and Javascript
    - We will try to have what we teach overlap as much as possible

## Data
![alt text](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/500x/78065400/data.jpg)

Is everything data?

## Variables and data types
### Basic Data Types
1. int, float, string, boolean
2. Variable declaration
3. Basic operators on numbers and strings

### Example: Using JS and Python as a Formula Calculator!
Python3 Online: https://repl.it/repls/InternationalCylindricalWeaverbird
Javascript Online: https://repl.it/repls/DeeppinkGrowlingAmoeba

### There are no `if`s or buts about it!
Python: `if`, `elif`, and `else`
Javascript: `if`, `else if`, and `else`

### Example: write your own divider
```> 10 3
False
> 10 2
True
```

### Lists!
Javascript
``` 
let o = [];
for (var x = 0; x < 10; x = x + 1){
      o.push(x);
}
console.log(o);
```

Python
```
o = list(range(10))
print(o)
```

### Loop D Loop!
Python: ```
for i in range(10):
  print(i**2)
```
Javascript
```
for(var x = 0; x < 10; x +=1){
  console.log(x*x);
}

### Example: Find primes up to 55

### Breaks and Continues
I give you x. Find 2 numbers in this list `[1,2,3,5,7,11,...53]` such that two numbers in the list sum to x.

Step 1: "This becomes that" becomes "histay ecomesbay hattay"
Step 2: "isthey ecomesbay atthey".
Step 3: Translate back!"

#'Coding'
Add a shift to each letter in a message
'abc' + 1 = 'bcd'
'aaa' + 2 = 'ccc'
