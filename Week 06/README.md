### Session 2 - Basic Algorithms examples

Talk points: Here we will see the importance of algorithms in designing efficient applications, and how we can benefit from using the advantages of efficient data structures and algorithms together to create very powerful systems.

### Applications of Sorting

  One of the most basic algorithms is sorting. Everyone is familiar with sorting. In real life we might have a bookshelf sorted by alphabetical order, which is useful for retrieving and finding the correct book at a later time.
  
There are many problems where sorting first will help to solve the problem more efficiently.
