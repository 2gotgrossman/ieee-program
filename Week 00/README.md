
- I am more than willing, and would be happy to mentor anyone - who is highly motivated - in any stage and give advice based on my experiences. I am also just in the start of my career, but I've had to overcome all kinds of obstacles and there is plenty of advice I can give for people looking for jobs in the Bay Area. Feel free to email me: pbonin.giovanni@gmail.com

- I decided to create this class to teach while I am the president of IEEE at the University of Miami to supplement the school's curriculum, open doors for students to engage in discussions and interactions on the subject, as well as create a foundational framework for our organization on campus for future semesters. 

- If someone else decides to run something similar to this on their campus, I am also running guest speakers (in addition to each of these sessions), and that's a really good way to engage professional experience in your organization, as well as have experienced engineers potentially help you with the program.
