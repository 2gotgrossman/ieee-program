# On The Self-Taught Software Engineer

Welcome! We're glad you could join us. You're in for a treat. 

### Our Goals
We have two goals in this course: 
1. To provide you with a base that will make you a top-notch software engineer.
2. To prepare you for *getting* a job in Silicon Valley.


### The Structure
We plan to structure this course as follows: We will meet on Mondays and Thursdays. 
- On Mondays, we will review (or learn if it is new for you!) key concepts on algorithms and data structures. We will also dive deep into an interesting Software Engineering topic. These will include Machine Learning, Big Data, System Design, Operating Systems, Parallel Programming, etc. 
- The goal of Mondays is to prepare you for interview questions and expose you to interesting areas of Software Engineering, which will guide your understanding of how software works and maybe inspire you to dive deep into one of these subjects.
- On Thursdays, we will do programming challenges. These will mostly be Interview Questions taken from 
[Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/)
but will also include questions from the ICPC programming competition.

## How to get the most out of the course

The way most of the veteran members of Software Engineering Club improved their skills is by **teaching yourself**. Coming to these classes is great: We'll teach you and provide you with a group of like-minded learners. However, you have to put in the time yourself.


I actually learned a lot about learning in this Coursera class I took in my last semester in college: 

- https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn
- A [couple](https://pastebin.com/JNbGxvp) of [summaries](https://workflowy.com/s/E9HW.jGUYboLrGj) of the course.

## How to get a job in Silicon Valley

1. Code, code, code

-  [ABC: Always Be Coding](https://medium.com/always-be-coding/abc-always-be-coding-d5f8051afce2#.4heg8zvm4)

2. Meet other software engineers and techies and apply for internships

3. Crack the coding interview

4. The rest is history


To practice, get one of the recommended books with a list of exercises and hammer through it! Do all these problems, do one per day, or do two, or three, depending on how much time you have. There's no excuse to not do at least one of them a day until you feel comfortable enough to go to an interview feeling that you will make it. 

Success leads to confidence (conversely from what people believe), so the more you successfully solve problems the more confident you will be. Start small, build your skills, and you will make it. It's hard to properly emphasize just how helpful these books are.

### It's All About Discipline
- People put too much emphasis on IQ as opposed to emotional intelligence. After a certain level of IQ what really matters is dedication, passion, and good discipline toward your work. Most of the famous genius engineers that we all know and heard of struggled with these topics too at one point, but with the right discipline and passion they became really good at it by sticking to it. So never be discouraged!

## Interview Process & General Interview Prep

1.Interview Confidence: Be confident, but not arrogant

2.Talk while you think, and code, explain everything that might be ambiguous

3.If running out of time and need shortcuts, explain how you would not do the shortcut in a real scenario

4.The interviewer is there because they want to hire someone, they are your friend not your enemy

### Important advice: Pick One Language for the Interview

- You can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the interview, but for Google, these are solid choices:

  --> C++
  
  --> Java
  
  --> Python

You need to be very comfortable in the language, and be knowledgeable, so pick one, and do all the practice problems in that language. The more you practice the more natural it will look like you feel at developing with the language, and that's important even though knowing the syntax itself isn't. But there is a subconscious feeling we get by looking at the flow of someone working with something, and it's important to give interviewers that feeling



### Advice on Studying for the Technical interview

1. You won't remember it all, but try to remember more of it. Here's how to[Retain Computer Science Knowledge](https://web.archive.org/web/20170308043107/https://googleyasheck.com/retaining-computer-science-knowledge/)

2. **Focus**
3. **Studying strategy: Implement it!** For each subject covered, read and watch the content covering it, and then **implement** it. Please, don't skip the implementation part, this is the most important one. Do not look at AVL trees and think "Oh we covered that in my algorithms class", the interviewer will never care what your class covered, he or she will ask you to implement it.

4. **Testing: ** Write tests to make sure the code works. Most interviewers also ask you to do that. (Or at least run through test cases, but run them on paper, not  simply by plugging the input in, because on the whiteboard they want to see if you can think through the code you just wrote.

So basically the process is: 
1. understand an algorithm or subject
2. implement it on paper (preferably whiteboard while talking through it as an interview)
3. test it by running through examples by hand and thinking through it
4. Implement on a computer and test with real inputs

Note: you should use standard libraries of python when practicing. Unless, for example, the question is sorting an array, then you should ask the interviewer whether he expects you to use the standard library or implement it yourself. When in doubt, always ask for clarification! Don't make assumptions, and don't be afraid to ask questions, it's a good thing.


# Let's Get to It! 

It's time to get to the knowledge.

### Get familiar with Git

Not familiar with git yet? No worries http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ 
Or, if you are a University of Miami student, you have a free subcription to Lynda.com and you can take this quick start Git and GitHub course: https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Up-Running-Git-GitHub/409275-2.html. Git is key to know if you plan to work on any software project that includes more than 1 person.


### Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis

- You should be so comfortable (after preparing and going through this) with algorithm complexity and Big-O notation that it is a natural process for you.
- You should be able to look at algorithms and spit out what the algorithm complexity is, and as the name might suggest otherwise, it is not complex at all. In fact it is a method for quickly managing complexity while getting a good evaluation on how the algorithm will run for large-scale applications.
- Imagine if you could do math, and simply get rid of all constants and lower order terms, and just say how the given function grows as the input grows, this is basically it.

## Data Structures

What are they? Well what are our primitives? Data structures create new ways to group primitives.

### Arrays
The key parts about arrays:
1. **Instant insertion, deletion, andl ookup:** You can find the Nth element in *constant time*. Why is this? 
2. **Fixed size:** Arrays don't grow in size. If we want an array to grow, we need to create a new array and copy each element into that array 1 by 1.
