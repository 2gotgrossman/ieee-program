# The Internet-Taught Software Engineer - A Student-to-Student Class 

### Note
Class Author: David Grossman

This is the time to take control of educating yourself. If your goal is to get a job in Silicon Valley, become a top-notch researcher, or start a startup, learning to teah yourself new things is key. As part of the Software Engineering Club, you are joining a group of self-motivated students interested in understanding the ins and outs of computers and software systems. 

This course will help you with 2 things: 
1. **Prepare for technical interview questions.** A key part in becoming a quality software engineer is getting your first internship or job. We will learn and practice the key knowledge that you will need in the general software technical interview.
2. **Expose you to interesting software engineering topics.** As Software Engineers, we develop good understanding of how computers work and how they will work in the near future. We will touch on interesting topics that you might not be exposed to in your courses and give you new concepts to explore on your own.


### Communication
Join our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/groups/UMACM/ for updates on the course! As the semester gets going and if there's interest, we can work on a Software Engineering Class specific communication method.
