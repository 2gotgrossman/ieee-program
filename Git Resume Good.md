"A good resume is like a movie trailer, short enough to be interesting yet gets someone excited for the full feature. If you are anything like a great script combined with an ensemble cast ready for a summer release then it should be fitting that the trailer serves judicially to your experience and your character. With that being said, the font Times New Roman says nothing good about your character." 
- Angelo Saraceno, MangoHacks coordinator


# Misc
1. Always export to PDF. Make sure it looks the same as it did in Word or Google Docs. If you're using Pages, think twice about your life choices.
