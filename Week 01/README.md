# Data Structures!

### Hash Tables
 - Hash Tables are beautiful things and extremely useful in a very large and diverse domain of applications. If you have seen them before, and you are under the impression that they are complicated, just forget anything you know about them. They are quite straightforward:
      - Starting with the easy part, "table", we have a data structure that represents a table mapping a value generally represented as a string, to another value of any type. That's what a table is, and if hash tables were just the running time to find a value in the table would be O(n), and it wouldn't be very useful.
       -> That's the power of "hashing", where we take the key which is the value that maps to another, and process it with a function (for example adding the ascii characters modulo the number of entries in the table, which works but we will later see can be optimized substantially), and finds where in the table it belongs
       - Know how hash tables are implemented, but more importantly know how to use them to build new systems.

### String Builders
- In java, how many Strings are created in this line of code?
```
String s = "h" + "e" + "l" + "l" + "o"
```
- With StringBuilder, use `append(String)`
- [StringBuilder Example Use](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/buffers.html)
- What's the meta-point? --> Implementation matters.


### Linked List
- If we use a list however, which is a series of items (call them nodes) connected by links, all we have to do is make the new element point to the first element of the array. If we want to insert elsewhere, it's similar, we just need to get the preceeding element and have its link point to the new element, and have the new element point to the one after the original element. And it follows that this takes O(1), whereas retrieving the Nth element takes O(N)

## What is Machine Learning?
*“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”* -- Tom Mitchell, Carnegie Mellon University
